# Coronavirus-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
Coronavirus Tweet Sentiment Analysis is an approach to analyse and predict sentiment of tweets related to COVID-19. The tweets can be analysed with the help of Classification and Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques, as the tweets can be categorized into discrete number of sentiments and those tweets will be in human language which have to be made possible for the computer to analyse them.

The dataset consists of the tweets from around the world along with the coded usernames and screennames of the Tweeter, location from which it was tweeted, time of the tweet and the sentiment of the tweet. Usernames and screennames are coded to avoid privacy concerns.

The steps of this analysis include data cleaning by handling null values, removing stopwords, special characters, URLâ€™s and many other unnecessary elements from the tweets, data exploration, data preprocessing, vectorization, modeling and evaluating individual models.
